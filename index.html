		<p>
			As a second-year engineering student at The National School of Engineers of Tunis, I am very interested in securing an internship with your organization. 
		</p>
		<p>
			What has motivated me to apply to this position is your firm's reputation as the best Managed Security Service Provider and one of the best ranked in mobile applications.
		</p>
		<p>
			With my avid interest and ongoing education in software engineering, as well as my skills in team collaboration and project support, I feel confident that I would make important and valuable contributions to your firm.
		</p>
		<p>
			With a solid foundation in the basics of software engineering—including Relational databases, web development and some basic network concepts—I am  prepared to put my knowledge and abilities to work for you, while also gaining immeasurable experience and transferable skills to enable me to advance in my career pursuits.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am sure that many people are as excited as I am to apply and not miss this great opportunity but I believe what makes me stand out from most applicants is my work ethic, sense of humor and, above all, my belief that every  project should be done with one person in mind: the consumer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you for consideration,
		</p>
		<p>
			Best regards,
		</p>
